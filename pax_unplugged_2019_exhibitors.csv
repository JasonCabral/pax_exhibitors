From Chess, Dungeons and Dragons, Titan, Stratego, Axis and Allies, Shogun, and Risk, to family game nights including Password and Rebound, gaming was an integral part of life. Craig took all this experience and became a game designer for Hasbro. Jeff became a teacher and used his love of games to create different ways for his students to experience history. After 20+ years in their respective careers the brothers decided it was time to pool their creativity and begin designing and publishing games for others to enjoy. They called their new company Soaring Rhino in honor of their father. Their mission is to provide “Innovative ideas, Thoughtful design, and Engaging games.” "
